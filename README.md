   This repository contains the routines for solving the
   transmission problem for Helmholtz equations 
   using a trapezoidal discretization and an alpert
   correction of varying orders.

   There are three main functionalities of this code:
   1. ability to extract near corrections required
      for fast direct solver coupling
   2. matrix generator for transmission problem
